## Contributing

We'd really like if you can take some time to make sure your coding style is
consistent with the project. Uguu follows [PHP
PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) and [Airbnb JavaScript
(ES5)](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es5-deprecated/es5) (`airbnb/legacy`)
coding style guides. We use ESLint and PHPCS tools to enforce these standards.

You can also help by sending us feature requests or writing documentation and
tests.

## Upcoming Features

* PostgreSQL Support
* S3 Bucket Support
* Azure File Storage Support
* Temporal/RR Support
