            <h2>What is <%= siteName %>?</h2>
            <p><%= siteName %> is a simple to use free file hosting service where files get
                deleted after <%= expireTime %>. It lets you share your photos, documents, music, videos and more with
                others online.</p>
            <h2>What files are allowed?</h2>
            <p>Any kind of file is allowed, as long as the file is legal in <%= ServerCountryLocation %> and you have the legal
                right to publish the file on our service.</p>
            <p>As an exception to this policy to prevent abuse, we do not allow malware on our service. Any malware that
                could be used to infect other computers may be removed from our service at our discretion.</p>
            <h2>Do you keep logs of uploaded files?</h2>
            <% if (LOG_IP) { %>
                <p>A database of the current active files are kept which includes the name, hash and IP of the file and time of upload,
                    this data is deleted when the file expires.</p>
            <% } else { %>
            <p>A database of the current active files are kept which includes the name and hash of the file and time of upload,
                this data is deleted when the file expires.</p>
            <% } %>
            <p>Downloads and visits are not tracked or logged in respect for your privacy.</p>
            <h2>Can you remove my copyrighted file?</h2>
            <p>
                Please submit your copyright takedown notice to
                <a href="mailto:<%= abuseContact %>"><%= abuseContact %></a>
                . We will
                handle your notice within <%= expireTime %> and disable access to the infringing file after receiving a notice
                compliant with the Copyright Act.
            </p>
            <h2>Can you remove files that are defaming me or otherwise infringing my non-copyright rights?</h2>
            <p>
                <%= siteName %> respects takedowns for other files when accompanied with a certified <%= ServerCountryLocation %> court order. If
                you are unable to obtain the order, a preliminary injuction or court order is typically also sufficient.
                Please forward the notice to
                <a href="mailto:<%= abuseContact %>"><%= abuseContact %></a>
                .
            </p>
            <h2>Can you remove illegal files?</h2>
            <p>Please contact the appropriate law enforcement agency if you notice illegal files hosted on <%= siteName %>. We
                have not been trained or qualified to investigate and fight crimes and enforce the law, so it's not
                appropriate to send accusations of illegal activity to us.</p>
            <p>
                You must contact the appropriate law enforcement office. They may then contact us if appropriate.
                If you are an law enforcement official and you need our assistance, please contact
                <a href="mailto:<%= abuseContact %>"><%= abuseContact %></a>
                . If you are a law enforcement official from another
                country, we may voluntarily cooperate if the crime you are investigating would also be illegal in
                <%= ServerCountryLocation %>.
            </p>
